Submitting jobs
=====
The queueing system SLURM is installed with two queues:

- `gpuqueue` for requesting a GPU
- `cpuqueue` (default) for requesting a CPU.

Both GPU and CPU machines are included in this queue, as the GPU machines also have CPUs available. For more information on Hardware setup, please see the :doc:`hardware` document.


When scheduling a job, take the architecture of the machines into consideration, as seen on the slide with Hardware Architecture.

A more elaborate guide to submitting jobs will come soon.
