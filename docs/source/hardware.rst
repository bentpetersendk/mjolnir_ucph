Mjolnir consist of both CPU and GPU nodes, each with very different CPU/GPU and memory setups.
Please note the differences in architecture when you are booking your jobs as it will affect the efficiency of the running jobs. 
If you book more resources than you use, then you will limit your colleagues to compute as well. Its a balance that needs to be adjusted.
